# Product Engraver

This repo contains a Chrome Extension which automates the process of generating product engravings.

As the user types in the engraving textbox, the current image is updated with their custom text.

Designers can adjust font, default text, and placement settings then use them to generate an engraving script which will work on any Shopify page.
